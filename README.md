I used [Toby Bookmarks](https://www.gettoby.com/) â€“ [Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toby-for-chrome/hddnkoipeenegfoeaoibdmnaalmgkpip)
for a while however there is no _official way_ to extract the content.

It's a shame, this a great product to share link collection among a team.

I used [Krishnan Srinivasan's documentation](https://gist.github.com/krishpop/8a954b171a5403117bf0f2fdda0a8e90) to extract it.

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Click on Toby Extension Icon
3. Select Open Toby
4. Open Chrome Developper Tools
5. Select the console
6. Paste the javascript code (e.g., exportTobyMD.js)
